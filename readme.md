# MyFeed
A place for users to discover and discuss articles with friends. Here are the general features planned for this project:
- Each user will have their own profile, to which they can easily add articles.
- Each user will have a feed that shows all of their friends' posts, in chronological order
- When posting articles you can specifically tag friends to get their input
- Send a link to an article through MyFeed so your friends can provide inline input to start the discussion.

Therefore, we must build the following pages:
- User profile
- Single article discussion page
- Article feed

Other things to build: 
- Landing page
- Sign up page

To run this project:
- npm i
- node app.js

Potential names/domains:
- readie.io
- friendforum.io



Hope you enjoy!
